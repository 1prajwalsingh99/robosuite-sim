# robosuite-sim

## Download instructions

To download files associated with Robosuite follow the instructions [on their website](https://robosuite.ai/docs/installation.html).

## Running the simulation

The most upto date simulation is in demoV1.py and the inputs used for the simulation are in sampleInputsRobo-Sheet1.csv.
To run the simulation you'd also need to source the GLEWsetup.sh using:

    source GLEWsetup.sh

## TODO

- assemble a setup.py or alternative installation process
- cleanup sample files
- more elegant way to source setup (see launch.json, but for normal execution)
- write description for what this repo is
- attribution for robosuite, mujoco
- "this project is a part of HOME" kind of thing with link to webpage
